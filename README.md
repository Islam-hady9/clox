# Clox Compiler

The Clox Compiler is a lightweight and extensible programming language implementation, designed for simplicity and ease of use. This repository contains the source code and related files for the Clox compiler.

## Overview

Clox is a dynamically-typed scripting language inspired by various programming languages, with a focus on providing a flexible and efficient execution environment. The compiler translates Clox source code into bytecode, which is then executed by the Clox Virtual Machine.

## Features

- **Dynamic Typing**: Clox supports dynamic typing, providing flexibility in variable declarations and usage.
- **Garbage Collection**: The compiler incorporates a garbage collector for automatic memory management.
- **Extensibility**: Designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for easy addition of new features and optimizations.

## Getting Started

To compile and run Clox programs, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Islam-hady9/clox.git
   cd clox
   ```
   
For more detailed instructions and examples, refer to the [Documentation](docs/) directory.
